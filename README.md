# To Do List
 
A to do list where you can save your daily goals and tasks. This web app is implemented by using node.js and express.js on server side, and EJS on front end. The items are stored in the MongoDB database.

In order to create custom lists, just append the name of the list to the url and the new list will be created and stored in the database. For example, if you want to create a list named "home", append /home to the url and that list will be curated for you.
